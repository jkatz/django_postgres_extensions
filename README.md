Django Extensions for PostgreSQL
================================

This library provides a few model field extensions used in Django, primarily tailored to PostgreSQL, the exception being MoneyField

For models, the extensions include:

* DayIntervalField
* EnumField
* HstoreField
* IntegerArrayField
* MoneyField
* PointField

For forms:

* IntegerArrayField
* MoneyField

This is a work-in-progress.  More to come in the near future.
